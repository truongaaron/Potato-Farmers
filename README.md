# cool-game
This game will be an idle game which will consist of potatoes.
I was thinking.. instead of clicking the potatoes, be able to 
move around in a 2D space as a character and allow for the player
to hit a potato instead. Think about like Terraria, but instead of 
mining blocks, we mine potatoes and use our "potato" currency in order
to buy more efficient tools to farm the potatoes.
